## 🗂️ Project structure

├── assets
│   ├── css

```

## 🚀 Getting started
1. Clone the repository and move into the project folder:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ananya15082002/Portfolio_Ananya_SIngh.git
   cd Portfolio_Ananya_SIngh
   ```
2. Open `index.html` directly in your favourite browser, or serve it locally with any static server (for example, using VS Code Live Server or `python -m http.server`).

## 🛠️ Customisation tips
- Replace `assets/images/ananya-singh.svg` with your own portrait (keep the same filename or update the image path in `index.html`).
- Update the resume download link in the hero section once your PDF is ready: replace `assets/Ananya_Singh_Resume.pdf` with the actual path or an external URL.
- Modify the projects section with real links for each project.
- Adjust colours and gradients inside `assets/css/styles.css` to match your personal branding.
